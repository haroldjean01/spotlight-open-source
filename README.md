### Reflection

I enjoyed using the Victory and Rsuite imports. I enjoyed the Rsuite because it was quite simple to use. The Victory import was enjoyable as well because of its many themes; Simply pick one and it does all the styling! When trying for the charts, I had issues with the React Table docs which led me to choose the Rsuite which imported properly with the version of React I have. It took me a while to read through the docs to find exactly what I needed. The thing that surprised me the most had to have been the preset themes Victory had built in.
